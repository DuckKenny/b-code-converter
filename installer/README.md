For better understanding this folder is called installer, but these are all executable that run standalone and don't need anything else to run.  

Version 1.0b (Beta):
- Linux (tested SteamOS, thus Manjaro/Arch should be fine as well)
- Windows 10 file is marked as 'win10' (make sure to switch to another OS or update to win11 for security reasons)
- Windows 11 file is just 'win'

Files created with PyInstaller and usage of the single python file.
